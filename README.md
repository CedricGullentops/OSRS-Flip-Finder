# OSRS Flip Finder


Bullseye's OSRS flip finder

I made this a few months ago just for fun. Since i'm not using it anymore it is free for who wants to use it or wants to build a similar project. This repository contains source files and an executable so you can either run it or compile a version yourself. The executable still works but the source code gives an error during the connection with ge-tracker to get item limits. If you have the limits.txt file in the same folder as the executable the program will still work but will not be updated for new items.

This program uses live rsbuddy data to give a list of potential flip items within your cash limit.
The info is displayed as followed:
Name
Buy price
Sell price
GE limit
Potential profit
Active buy quantity
Active sell quantity

In essence you want to find items that have a good potential profit with high limit and active buyers and sellers.

If you have any questions let me know.
Have fun and good luck flipping!
