# OSRS Flip Finder


Bullseye's OSRS flip finder

I made this a few months ago just for fun. Since i'm not using it anymore it is free for who wants to use it or wants to build a similar project. This repository only contains source files and no executable so you will have to compile one yourself.

This program uses live rsbuddy data to give a list of potential flip items within your cash limit.
The info is displayed as followed:
Name
Buy price
Sell price
GE limit
Potential profit
Active buy quantity
Active sell quantity

If you have any questions let me know.
Have fun and good luck flipping!
